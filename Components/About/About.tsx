            Hello! My name is Enoch and I enjoy developing responsive and
            functional websites. Frontend development has been my main focus for
            some years now, it all started back in 2018 when I was playing
            around Blogger, trying to figure out how blogs were built. And some
            months later, I began learning HTML/CSS.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fast-forward to today, I have built website in the esports
            tournaments sector, and experience in managing lots of varied tasks,
            collaborating with others as part of a team, and effective
            communication
            <br />
            <br />
            The constant change in the techonologies used in frontend
            development is something I find joy in as I am always looking to
            improve and learn cool stuffs. Which is why I tasked myself with
            diving into Web3. And building smart contracts with solidity and
            integrating it to the frontend has been really fun.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
          </p>

          <SimpleGrid columns={{ sm: 3, md: 3, lg: 3 }} spacing={3}>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>
              <NextJsIco className={styles.nextIco} />
              <p>Next Js</p>
            </div>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>
              <TypeScriptIco />
              <p>TypeScript</p>
            </div>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>
              <ReduxIco />
              <p>Redux</p>
            </div>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>

              <p>JavaScript</p>
            </div>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>

              <p>Firebase</p>
            </div>
            <div className={styles.languageDiv}>
              <SolidityIco className={styles.solidityIco} />
              <p>Solidity</p>
            </div>
          </SimpleGrid>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.enochParent}>

          />
          <img
            className={styles.enochImg}
            src="/img/Enoch Fabiyi.png"
            alt="Enoch Fabiyi"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
